# Game of Twilights

_This is the initial stage of the project. As the project work goes on, the content of this page and all others will consequently improve._

## Description
This is an attempt to create a digital version of the 4th edition of a popular board game ["Twilight Imperium"](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition/ "Fantasy Flight Games link"). It is expected to be a standalone desktop application written mostly in Python which would be useful for playing by network.

## Contributions
A set of tips explaining how anyone can contribute to this project will be published in `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` as soon as some ideas are figured out. For now, if You are interested in helping to organize any sections (wiki pages or this readme, for example), You can contact me via [e-mail](mailto:idovgalyov@4xxi.com "idovgalyov@4xxi.com") with a detailed description of your suggestions. Creating an [issue](https://github.com/idovgalyov-4xxi/Game-of-Twilights/issues/new) might also be a nice way!

## Wiki
We are planning to use project wiki for storing descriptions, roadmaps, concepts, schemes, and whatever else can be good enough to get into.

## History and origins
The idea of re-creating TI4 on a computer came to me accidentally.
I admired by the 4th edition of "Twilight Imperium" and especially by its graphical design.

I am a Python developer with intermediate programming experience.

I also do my postgraduate studies in astronomy (more specifically in celestial mechanics).

And I love playing boardgames.

Possibly this fine combination of three caused me to take the dare.

## Acknowledgements
No doubt this list will expand.
