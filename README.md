# Game of Twilights

> Yet another game where you can play for Khajiit ðŸ„¯

_This is the pre-development stage of the project. As the project work goes on, the content of this page and all others will consequently improve._

## Description
This is an attempt to create a digital version of the 4th edition of a popular board game ["Twilight Imperium"][ffg].
It is expected to be a standalone desktop application written mostly in Python which would be useful for playing by network.

## TODO list
[`TODO`][todo] wiki page is a list of big tasks and issues that are to deal with in the near future.

## History and origins
The idea of re-creating TI4 on a computer came to me accidentally.
I admired by the 4th edition of "Twilight Imperium" and especially by its graphical design.

I am a Python developer with intermediate programming experience.  
I also do my postgraduate studies in astronomy (specifically in celestial mechanics).  
And I love playing boardgames.

Possibly this fine combination of three caused me to take the dare and start working.

## Acknowledgements
No doubt this list will expand.
