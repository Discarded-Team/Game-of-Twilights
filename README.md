# Game of Twilights

_This is the very beginning of all works. As the project work goes on, the content of this page and all others will consequently improve_

## Description
This is an attempt to create a digital version of a popular board game "Twilight Imperium IV". It is expected to be a standalone desktop application written mostly in Python which would be useful for playing by network.

## Contributions
A set of tips explaining how anyone can contribute to this project will be published in `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` as soon as some ideas are figured out.

## Wiki
We are planning to use project wiki for storing descriptions, roadmaps, concepts, and whatever else that is good enough to be there.

## History and origins
The idea of re-creating TI4 on a computer came to me accidentally.
I was admired by the 4th edition of "Twilight Imperium" and especially by its graphical design.

I am a Python developer with intermediate programming experience.

I also do my postgraduate studies in astronomy (more specifically in celestial mechanics).

And I love playing boardgames.

Possibly this fine combination of three caused me to take the dare.

## Acknowledgements
No doubt this list will expand.
