# Contributing
**At first, thanks a lot for your interest on this project!**

## How you can help
The project is currently on a pre-development stage with small amount of source code as the work is mostly focused on documentation and structuring concepts and ideas.
you can help by:

- [Asking questions](#asking-questions)

- [Making the project appearance look better with README](#improving-readme)

- [Proposing improvements for wiki](#improving-wiki)

- [Sharing your ideas for the code development via issues and pull requests](#issues-and-pull-requests)

- [Updating this file with better ways for contribution](#contribution-ways)

- [Finding text errors](#errors)

If you are interested in help by some of these ways, you can [create an issue][issue] with a detailed description of your suggestions or contact us directly via [e-mail](mailto:idovgalyov@4xxi.com "idovgalyov@4xxi.com"). If you are not sure whether your suggestion is unique or reasonable enough, please also refer to [F.A.Q.] section to be aware of most common questions.

### Asking questions
Even this little action is very helpful. Questions can help us, as developers, to systematize our knowledge of the project and let us understand better how the project should be built, which way to go, what the real reasons for doing something are, and more other.
The most polular questions can get to the [F.A.Q.] wiki page so later they would help, in turn, potential users and collaborators to orient themselves in the project.

### Improving README
We let [README](README.md) stand out from other documentation as it responds for the first look on the project and rather affect project popularity in all.
Any ideas how to make it better are welcome.

### Improving wiki
We use [wiki] to store various information about the project like descriptions, concepts, roadmaps, and so on.
The current version of project wiki is far from ideal, and there is almost always something can be found useful enough to be added.

### Issues and pull requests
[Creating an issue][issue] or offering [pull request] is a standard way of contributing in case the code development.
Issues are often useful for bug reports and feature requests while pull requests are created to propose prepared improvements.
Currently, the guidelines of proper formatting issues and pull requests for this project are not well-defined as a stable code base is at the creation stage.

### Contribution ways
If you see or notice other useful formal ways related to the process of contributing not presented here, you can offer them as well. All in all, once we can all start using Skype for issue tracking, who knows =)

### Errors
Finally, as some authors of the project are not English natives, they do not mind confessing that they do mistakes in the text and violate the style quite likely. If you find a mistake or not sure if some phrases are clear, feel free to ask questions and propose corrections.
